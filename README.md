# Trackball-Type 3D Mouse Development Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a "trackball-type 3D mouse" that enables intuitive camera movement in 3D modeling software.  
We address the current limitations of 3D mice, enhancing the user experience with a new design and system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- To create a 3D mouse that allows intuitive camera manipulation.
- To support major 3D modeling software such as Fusion360 and Blender.
- To offer a high-performance, cost-efficient alternative in the 3D mouse market.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features
- **Trackball Design**: Supports 360-degree rotation across three axes using a trackball input.
- **Intuitive Operation**: Movement and rotation seamlessly translate into 3D perspective control.
- **Customizability**: Software settings and add-ons allow for personalized functionality.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Designed to be more affordable than existing 3D mice on the market.
